E-sports review- DOTA 2 TI8

Welcome to my review. This is essenially the final 6 fights of the dota 2 2018 international put into a summery with their results 
and a bit on information about the team. I have chosen to only review the final 6 battles as there was many many fights over the 
course of the tournament so I simply could not include them all, I feel like these games had a good mix of teams and a variety of 
skill and this would be enough to bring my site to its potential. It also shows some information about dota and the history and the 
sceane behind it as well as the option to download the game for yourself.  

UX-
This site is aimed towards anyone who has an intrest in E-sports whether you are experianced in the subject or on not, my site has
some history on previous internations for some catch up on people who may not be familliar with it and moment where it explains dota 2 
terminology but also points where its adressing heros in the game to the people who know the game well. Making this site accustomed to 
all that want to know about the topic.
As someone who was intrested in the topic of E-sports myself I understod what information was needed and what information was not worth 
mentioning. Its a simple design as somthing like this has no need for complication because the information just needs to be presented well.
-see the image folder for wireframes-.

Features-
1. The ability to view all of the results with a simple scroll, it is easy for the user to find the results they are searching for. 
2. The modal function prevents an overload of pages bty each fight not needing its own file but instead just a pop up, keeping results in the same place.
3. The team function allows you to see who is on the team you were shouting for also with a clear indication on who the captain is. 
4. The about feature means you can catch up on what dota is about and a bit of its history for the users not as educated on the topic aswell an information in the footer.
5. The download feautre means after seeing all this contect for one of the most intense internations you can have a go at the game for yourself, targeted for begginers.
6. The nav bar allows an easy navigation process with a simple amount of options making it clear where your information will be.
 
A desired feautre would be to be able to click on a players image or name to then be taken to another page with informtion about them specifically which would give you a 
better understanding of your prefered player.

Testing- 
For testing I was very carefull, after every edit of code I would be sure to make sure that only the information I wanted to change was what changed. I would also at the end of 
evey day of work lookat what I have added and load up the site and not treat is as my own but as I was a user, trying to find specific bits of information I would liek to know 
and seeing if I was able to get to them.

Deployment- 
I commited to git up either at the end of everyday of working or after each major improvment, If i was to do this assesment again I would make more commits after the smaller modifications 
to make changes easier to identify and locate.
